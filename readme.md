# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

## Justine Evans

I have decided to take this class because I have always been interested in how websites work, and how I can showcase my work on the internet.

But what really is the internet? I was really amazed to learn that:

- While connectivity is the end-game, there's no "central control" or solitary operation with supreme power. The web is largely a people's technology.
- October 29, 1969: The first message sent over the internet was simply "lo" - just two characters - before the system crashed. Today, internet traffic generates 52 gigabytes in just one second.
- "It's estimated that every web page is an average of only 19 clicks away from every other web page." I cannot even comprehend this.
